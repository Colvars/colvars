/// \brief Parent class for a member object of a bias, cv or cvc etc. containing features and
/// their dependencies, and handling dependency resolution
///
/// There are 3 kinds of features:
/// 1. Dynamic features are under the control of the dependency resolution
/// system. They may be enabled or disabled depending on dependencies.
/// 2. User features may be enabled based on user input (they may trigger a failure upon dependency resolution, though)
/// 3. Static features are static properties of the object, determined
///   programmatically at initialization time.
///
/// The following diagram summarizes the dependency tree at the bias, colvar, and colvarcomp levels.
/// Isolated and atom group features are not shown to save space.
