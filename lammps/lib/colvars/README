## Collective variables module (Colvars)

A software module for molecular simulation and analysis that provides a
high-performance implementation of sampling algorithms defined on a reduced
space of continuously differentiable functions (aka collective variables).

The module itself implements a variety of functions and algorithms, including
free-energy estimators based on thermodynamic forces, non-equilibrium work and
probability distributions.

## How to build

This directory has source files to build a library that LAMMPS
links against when using the USER-COLVARS package.

This library must be built with a C++ compiler, *before* LAMMPS is built, so
that LAMMPS can link against it.  You can use the provided Makefile.* files or
create your own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

  make -f Makefile.g++

When you are done building this library, two files should
exist in this directory:

libcolvars.a		the library LAMMPS will link against
Makefile.lammps		settings the LAMMPS Makefile will import

IMPORTANT: You must examine the final Makefile.lammps to insure it is
correct for your system, else the LAMMPS build will likely fail.

If you want to set a debug flag recognized by the library, the
settings in Makefile.common should work.
