# Collective variables module (Colvars)

A software module for molecular simulation and analysis that provides a high-performance implementation of sampling algorithms defined on a reduced space of continuously differentiable functions (aka collective variables).

First released in 2008 as part of the standard distribution of [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) version 2.7b1, Colvars has also been integrated in [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html) and [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).  Pre-patched [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) releases are also available ([see below](#gromacs-colvars-releases)).

The module itself implements a variety of functions and algorithms, including free-energy estimators based on thermodynamic forces, non-equilibrium work and probability distributions.

## Obtaining and using

The easiest way to obtain pre-compiled versions of Colvars is via one of following:
- the molecular simulation program [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html);
- the molecular simulation program [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/);
- the molecular visualization program [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (version 1.9.4 alpha and later).

Please check [here](https://github.com/Colvars/colvars/wiki/List-of-Colvars-versions-included-in-simulation-and-analysis-packages) to see which version of Colvars is included with the round-number or "stable" versions of each code.

For the molecular simulation program [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/), code may be compiled via our Colvars-patched [releases](#gromacs-colvars-releases).

## Documentation

The [Colvars webpage](https://colvars.github.io/) includes user documentation for the four codes, as well as a Doxygen-based [developer documentation](https://colvars.github.io/doxygen/html/).

## Example input

Colvars requires a configuration file, or alternatively configuration arguments given through scripting commands by the linked program.
- In NAMD:
```
colvars on
cv configfile <Colvars configuration file>
```
- In VMD (_Tip:_ try also the new "Colvars Dashboard" plugin):
```
cv molid top
cv configfile <Colvars configuration file>
```
- In LAMMPS:
```
fix Colvars all colvars configfile <Colvars configuration file>
```
- In GROMACS:
```
gmx mdrun -s topol.tpr -deffnm topol -colvars <Colvars configuration file>
```

The contents of the configuration file are typically the same across all programs, for example:
```
colvar { # Define a new variable
  name d # Must give a name to this variable
  width 0.2 # Estimated fluctuation amplitude and/or grid resolution, "w_d"
  distance { # This variable is a distance between centers of mass (COMs)
    group1 { atomNumbers 1 2 3 } # List the atoms of the 1st group
    group2 { atomNumbers 4 5 6 } # List the atoms of the 2nd group
  }
}

harmonic { # Define a harmonic potential, 1/2*K*(d-d0)^2/w_d^2
  colvars d # Apply it to the variable "d"
  centers 5.0 # The center of the potential, "d0"
  forceConstant 10.0 # Force constant, "K"
}
```


Complete input decks for some of the most commonly used features are available in the `examples` repository:
https://github.com/Colvars/examples

See also the [examples](https://github.com/Colvars/colvars/tree/master/examples?raw=true) folder of this repository for other examples of configurations.  Configuration options (particularly, the selections of atoms) require minimal changes to reflect the specifics of each simulation.

The [tests](https://github.com/Colvars/colvars/tree/master/tests?raw=true) folder also contains functional segments of Colvars configuration, used to build numerical tests of code accuracy and stability.  Feel free to use these segments in your production runs.

## Updating to the latest version

To recompile each program with the most recent version of the module, [download](https://github.com/Colvars/colvars/archive/master.zip) the `master` branch of this repository, or clone it via git:
```
git clone https://github.com/Colvars/colvars.git
```
and run the provided `update-colvars-code.sh` script against the unpacked source tree of any of the supported programs:
```
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/lammps           ; # updates LAMMPS
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/NAMD_X.YY_Source ; # updates NAMD
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/vmd-X.Y.Z        ; # updates VMD
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/vmd-plugins      ; # updates VMD plugins
./update-colvars-code.sh /path/to/gromacs-XXX.X    ; # update GROMACS
```
and recompile them.

The `update-colvars-code.sh` script support patching the latest development version of each program:
- the [LAMMPS GitHub repository](https://github.com/lammps/lammps);
- the [NAMD GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/tcbgUIUC/namd);
- the [CVS repositories of VMD and its plugins](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/doxygen/cvsget.html).

**Note:** For [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/), support for specific release series is currently maintained; pre-patched versions of specific releases are provided [below](#gromacs-colvars-releases).

## Gromacs-Colvars releases

The following links allow to download several versions of Gromacs already patched to include the latest available version of Colvars:

 - **Gromacs version 2021.4-colvars** in [Tar.gz](https://github.com/Colvars/gromacs/archive/v2021.4-colvars.tar.gz) and [Zip](https://github.com/Colvars/gromacs/archive/v2021.4-colvars.zip) formats

 - **Gromacs version 2020.6-colvars** in [Tar.gz](https://github.com/Colvars/gromacs/archive/v2020.6-colvars.tar.gz) and [Zip](https://github.com/Colvars/gromacs/archive/v2020.6-colvars.zip) formats

 - **Gromacs version 2018.8-colvars** in [Tar.gz](https://github.com/Colvars/gromacs/archive/v2018.8-colvars.tar.gz) and [Zip](https://github.com/Colvars/gromacs/archive/v2018.8-colvars.zip) formats

Gromacs-Colvars versions not listed above are not supported, but the same [patching procedure](#updating-to-the-latest-version) is generally portable across the same Gromacs release series (i.e. labeled with the same year).

When using the [Gromacs forum](https://gromacs.bioexcel.eu/) to discuss usage of any Colvars-patched version of GROMACS, please specify "GROMACS modification: **Yes**" and use the [`colvars` tag](https://gromacs.bioexcel.eu/tag/colvars) when posting your forum message.

## Which version of Colvars is recommended?

The Git `master` branch is to be considered the "*stable*" release at any given time; any bugfixes are released through `master` first.  The input syntax is near-completely *backward-compatible* and output files are *forward-compatible*.  Feel free to download Colvars and update NAMD, VMD, LAMMPS or GROMACS as needed.

Other branches are dedicated to the development of specific features: please use them at your own discretion.

## Which version of Colvars is included in package XX version YY?

The specific version of Colvars is identified both in the code and in the documentation by the date of the most recent code revision (e.g. `2021-01-19`). 
This date is printed to the standard output or log file as soon as Colvars is activated.

A table mapping software package release versions to Colvars versions is given [here](https://github.com/Colvars/colvars/wiki/List-of-Colvars-versions-included-in-simulation-and-analysis-packages).


If you are using a stable release of any of the codes mentioned above, feel free to use the version number of that code when asking questions.
