# This file defines features. They will be used in
# (1) defining the preprocessing layer of neural networks; 
# (2) plotting histogram of trajectory data;
# (3) defining a two-dimensional space to plot the learned functions.

# A feature is defined by the name, the feature type, and selectors used in the package MDAnalysis. 
# Different parts of each line are seperated by ','.
# Supported types are: angle, bond, dihedral, and position.

# A comment line starts from '#', and is not processed. 

# Note: to keep the order of atoms, use 'bynum 5, bynum 2', instead of 'bynum 5 2'
